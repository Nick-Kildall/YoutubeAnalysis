    <center><h3><b>About our project</b></h3></center>
    
    <p>Our dataset has <b>18798 rows and 16 columns</b>. 
    This is a large dataframe which gave us a lot of different ways to analyze 
    our data.The earliest date in our dataset is <b>2020-08-03 and the latest 
    recorded date is 2020-11-14</b>.
    This dataset only covers recent months. This is useful to keep in mind when 
    anaysing data because this most likely effects the results in some way.The
    column names are: video_id, title, publishedAt, channelId, channelTitle,
    categoryId, trending_date, tags, view_count, likes, dislikes, comment_count,
    thumbnail_link, comments_disabled, ratings_disabled, description. These 
    values are extremely helpful to know when working with the dataset because 
    they let you manipulate the data to pull out useful information. Here are 
    some of the take aways of our project;</p>
    <ul>
      
      <li><b> Aggregate Table</b></li><p>
        For the table, we grouped by and sorted by categoryId from the dataset 
        to see which category trends the most, and other details that might come
        with it. We found out that <b>Music came out as the most trending 
        category with the highest average views</b>, and most comments, <b>while
        the category with the most likes is Film & Animation</b>. As for the 
        title stat, we added that to see if having a video title in all caps can
        influence the ability to trends as shown on the table.</p>

      <li><b> Amount of Time for a Video to Trend</b></li><p>
        This graph shows the variation of the time it takes a video to reach the
        trending page after it’s published. The graph provides us with the mean,
        median, min, and max values of how long it took a video to trend and is 
        grouped by category.
        Most of the data is concentrated between the 0 to 5 day range, while 
        there are some outliers above 10 days for most categories. Interestingly
        enough, the data also included values with negative values. This is 
        because the published date includes the full date and time, whereas the 
        trending date only includes the month and day. For videos to have a 
        negative value of days it took to reach the trending page, it means that
        the video was wildly popular enough to be trending on the same date it 
        was uploaded. When plotting the graph, we decided that it was best to 
        replace the negative time values with a 0 in order to keep consistency 
        because negative time values are not technically correct.</p>
        <img src="img/Video2trend.jpg" alt = "Video2trendpic" class="center">
        <center></center>
        Based on the information provided by the graph, the Music category seems
        to have an overwhelming amount of outliers that began trending far after
        the video was published. This is most likely due to the fact that new 
        music takes time to circulate around before it becomes popular on
        mainstream media.<p></p>
        
      <li><b>A Trending Categories Chart</b></li><p>
        This pie chart displays the distribution of each video category found
        within the trending section as a percentage. Each section of the pie- 
        chart represents a proportion to the total number of videos within the 
        trending section during the 3 month period we pulled our data from.
        When hovering over a specific section of the graph users are provided 
        with the category name, the number of videos that fall under that
        specific category from our data, and the percentage of the whole are 
        rounded to two decimal places that represents how frequent a particular 
        category makes it into the trending section. We created this chart to 
        get an idea of what videos make it onto YouTube’s trending section more 
        frequently than others.
        <img src="img/Trendingcat.jpg" alt = "Trendingcatpic" class="center">
        <center></center>
        From looking at the graph, it is clear to see that the <b>majority of 
        videos that make it into the trending section are Music, Entertainment, 
        and Sports</b>, with the combination of the three making up over 50% of  
        the fifteen unique categories that were found in our data. <b>An 
        interesting bit of information that we found was that YouTube has more 
        than just 15 unique categories, but the trending section seems to group 
        several categories into a main category to be used in their trending 
        section</b>.<p></p>
      
      <li> <b>An Average Viewership Plot</b></li><p>
        This plot displays the average amount of views trending videos recieved 
        on a given day (Sunday to Saturday). We created this chart to see if 
        there is a relationship between average viewership and the day of the 
        week.
        <img src="img/Avgview.jpg" alt = "Avgview" class="center">
        <center></center>
        This graph clearly shows that trending <b>videos on Friday receive
        nearly triple the average viewership</b>. Additionally, <b>Wednesday is
        a particularly slow day for YouTube videos</b>. This may mean that 
        popular creators should attempt to have a video on the trending page 
        every Friday because this is when they would likely receive the highest 
        viewership.
    </ul>
