    <h3><b>Graph Introduction</b></h3>
   
    <p> This graph shows the variation in time it takes for a video to reach the trending page after it's published.<br/>
	The graph provides us with the median, min, and max values of how long it took a video to trend and is grouped by the category it was tagged under.

    <h3><b>Data Analysis</b></h3>

    <p> Most of the data is concentrated between the 0 to 5 day range, while there are some outliers above 10 days for most categories. Interestingly 	enough, the data also included values with negative values. This is because the published date includes the full date and time, whereas the 	trending date only includes the month and day. For videos to have a negative value of days it took to reach the trending page, it means that the 	video was wildly popular enough to be trending on the same date it was uploaded. When plotting the graph, I felt that it was best to replace the 	negative time values with a 0 in order to keep consistency because negative time values are not technically correct.<br/><br/>

	Based on the information provided by the graph, the Music category seems to have an overwhelming amount of outliers that began trending far after 	the video was published. This is most likely due to the fact that new music takes time to circulate around before it becomes popular on mainstream 	media.
