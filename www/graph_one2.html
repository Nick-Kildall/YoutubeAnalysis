    <p> The graph above shows that — in general — trending videos on Friday receive nearly triple
    the average viewership. Additionally, Wednesday is a particularly slow day
    for YouTube videos. <br> <br>
    
    However, the above statement is too broad. Try looking at the reactive
    chart above and you will see that some categories behave much differently
    than the general dataset. In particular, some categories such as "gaming" &
    "how to & style" receive regular viewership thoughout the week. This 
    information could help YouTube creators figure out the best time to post
    a video in a certain niche.
