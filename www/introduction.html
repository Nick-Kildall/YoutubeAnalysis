    <p>We are frequent consumers of YouTube and we are curious as to what makes
    a YouTube video trending. The trending section can only show a limited
    number of videos each day and captures what is currently going on in the
    world with videos that appeal to a wide range of viewers. Through this
    project, we would like to explore the logistics behind why these videos
    end up in the trending category.</p>
