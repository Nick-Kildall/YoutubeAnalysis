    <h3>About our project</h3>
    
    <p>Trending YouTube videos capture what is going on in the world through a variety
       of different categories. YouTube videos are something that almost everyone in 
       the United States is familiar with. However, the types of videos and <b>the 
       logistics behind the videos that make the trending section are not as 
       well known</b>. In this report we will analyze what factors support videos making 
       it into YouTube's trending section <i>through summaries, tables, and visual 
       representations</i> of our findings from our data set. The data set we will be
       using to conduct this analysis was created and organized by 
       <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset?select=US_youtube_trending_data.csv">Rishav Sharma.</a>
       We pulled this data set on November 14th, 2020 and thus the data we are analyzing
       contains values from August 3rd, 2020 to November 14th, 2020. It is important
       to note that our analysis is only for videos <b>in the United States</b> and does 
       not contain correlations between the factors we are analyzing and other
       countries. Due to pulling values only halfway through November, the sample
       size of videos from that month is smaller than others.</p>
    
    <h3>Why are we interested in this domain?</h3>
    
    <p>We are frequent consumers of YouTube and we are curious as to what makes
    a YouTube video trending. The trending section can only show a limited
    number of videos each day and captures what is currently going on in the
    world with videos that appeal to a wide range of viewers. Through this
    project, we would like to explore the logistics behind why these videos
    end up in the trending category.</p>
    
    <h3>What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>When were trending videos posted?</li>
        <li>What are the most common characteristics of trending videos</li>

   the logistics behind what makes a video become trending. </p>
