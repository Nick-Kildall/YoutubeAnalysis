    <p>This pie chart displays the distribution of each video category found
    within the trending section as a percentage. Each section of the pie 
    represents a proportion to the total number of videos within the trending 
    section during the 4 month period we pulled our data from.
    </p>
    
    <p>When hovering over a specific section of the graph you are provided with 
    the category name, the number of videos that  fall under that specific 
    category from our data, and the percentage of the whole rounded to two 
    decimal places that represents how frequent a particular category makes it 
    into the trending section. We created this chart to get an  idea of what 
    types of videos make it onto YouTube's trending section more frequently than
    others.</p>
    
    <p>From looking at the graph, it is clear to see that the majority of videos 
    that make it into the trending section are Music, Entertainment, and 
    Sports, with the combination of the three making up over 50% of the 
    fifteen unique categories that were found in our data. An interesting bit 
    of information that I found was that YouTube has more than just 15 unique
    categories, but the trending section seems to group several categories into 
    a main category to be used in their trending section.</p>
