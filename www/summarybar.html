    <h3><b>An Average Viewership Plot</b></h3><p>
        <p>This plot displays the average amount of views trending videos 
        recieved on a given day (Sunday to Saturday). We created this chart to 
        see if there is a relationship between average viewership and the day of
        the week.</p>
    
        <p>This graph clearly shows that trending <b>videos on Friday receive
        nearly triple the average viewership</b>. Additionally, <b>Wednesday is
        a particularly slow day for YouTube videos</b>. This may mean that 
        popular creators should attempt to have a video on the trending page 
        every Friday because this is when they would likely receive the highest 
        viewership.</p>
