    <h3><b>An Average Viewership Plot</b></h3><p>
        <p>This plot displays the average amount of views trending videos 
        recieved on a given day (Sunday to Saturday). We created this chart to 
        see if there is a relationship between average viewership and the day of
        the week.</p>
    
        <p>This graph clearly shows that trending <b>videos on Friday receive
        nearly triple the average viewership</b>. Additionally, <b>Wednesday is
        a particularly slow day for YouTube videos</b>. This may mean that 
        popular creators should attempt to have a video on the trending page 
        every Friday because this is when they would likely receive the highest 
        viewership.</p>
        
        <p>In the "Average Views by Category" section you can uncover many 
        other additional trends. In particular, we found that some 
        categories such as "gaming" and "how to & style" had fairly 
        even viewership throughout the week. If you are interested 
        in specific trends rather than the broad trends we mentioned, 
        feel free to look at our "Average Views by Category" chart 
        to learn about when trending videos in your category of 
        interest perform best.</p>
