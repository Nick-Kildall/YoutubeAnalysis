    <h3><b>Published Date vs Trending Date</b></h3>
        <p>This plot displays the average amount of views trending videos 
        recieved on a given day (Sunday to Saturday). We created this chart to 
        see if there is a relationship between average viewership and the day of
        the week.</p>
    
        <p>This graph shows the variation of the time it takes a video to reach 
        the trending page after it was published. The graph provides us with 
        the mean, median, min, and max values of how long it took a video to 
        trend and is grouped by category. <br>
        
        Most of the data is concentrated between the 0 to 5 day range, while 
        there are some outliers above 10 days for most categories. Interestingly
        enough, the data also included values with negative values. This is 
        because the published date includes the full date and time, whereas the 
        trending date only includes the month and day. For videos to have a 
        negative value of days it took to reach the trending page, it means that
        the video was wildly popular enough to be trending on the same date it 
        was uploaded. When plotting the graph, we decided that it was best to 
        replace the negative time values with a 0 in order to keep consistency 
        because negative time values are not technically correct.</p>
        
        <p>Based on the information provided by the graph, the Music category 
        seems to have an overwhelming amount of outliers that began trending far
        after the video was published. This is most likely due to the fact that
        new music takes time to circulate around before it becomes popular on
        mainstream media.</p>
