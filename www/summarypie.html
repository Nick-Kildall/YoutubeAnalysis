    <h3><b>Trending Categories Chart</b></h3>
    <p>This pie chart displays the distribution of each video category found
        within the trending section as a percentage. Each section of the pie- 
        chart represents a proportion to the total number of videos within the 
        trending section during the 4 month period we pulled our data from.
        When hovering over a specific section of the graph you are provided 
        with the category name, the number of videos that fall under that
        specific category from our data, and the percentage of the whole are 
        rounded to two decimal places that represents how frequent a particular 
        category makes it into the trending section. We created this chart to 
        get an idea of what videos make it onto YouTubes trending section more 
        frequently than others.</p>
    
        <p>The categories that dominated the trending section comprising of over
        50% of the overall trending section were <b>Music, Entertainment, and
        Sports.</b></p>
