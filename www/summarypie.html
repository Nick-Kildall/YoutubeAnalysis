    <h3><b>Trending Categories Chart</b></h3>
    <p>This pie chart displays the distribution of each video category found
        within the trending section as a percentage. Each section of the pie- 
        chart represents a proportion to the total number of videos within the 
        trending section during the 3 month period we pulled our data from.
        When hovering over a specific section of the graph users are provided 
        with the category name, the number of videos that fall under that
        specific category from our data, and the percentage of the whole are 
        rounded to two decimal places that represents how frequent a particular 
        category makes it into the trending section. We created this chart to 
        get an idea of what videos make it onto YouTubes trending section more 
        frequently than others.</p>
    
        <p>From looking at the graph, it is clear to see that the <b>majority of 
        videos that make it into the trending section are Music, Entertainment, 
        and Sports</b>, with the combination of the three making up over 50% of  
        the fifteen unique categories that were found in our data. <b>An 
        interesting bit of information that we found was that YouTube has more 
        than just 15 unique categories, but the trending section seems to group 
        several categories into a main category to be used in their trending 
        section</b></p>
