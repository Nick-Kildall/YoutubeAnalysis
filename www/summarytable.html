        <h3><b>About our dataset</b></h3>
    
        <p>Our dataset has <b>18798 rows and 16 columns</b>. 
        This dataset gave us a lot of different ways to analyze our data. 
        The earliest date in our dataset is <b>2020-08-03 and the latest 
        recorded date is 2020-11-14</b>.
    
        This dataset only covers recent months. This is useful to keep in mind 
        when anaysing data because this most likely effects the results in some 
        way. The column names are: video_id, title, publishedAt, channelId, 
        channelTitle, categoryId, trending_date, tags, view_count, likes, 
        dislikes, comment_count, thumbnail_link, comments_disabled,
        ratings_disabled, description. Thesevalues are extremely helpful to know
        when working with the dataset because they let you manipulate the data 
        topull out useful information. Here are some of the take aways of our 
        project</p>
      
        <h3><b>Aggregate Table</b></h3>
        <p>For the table, we grouped by and sorted by categoryId from the 
        dataset to see which category trends the most, and other details that 
        might come with it. We found out that <b>Music came out as the most 
        trending category with the highest average views</b> and most comments, 
        <b>while the category with the most likes is Film & Animation</b>. 
        As for the video title statistic, we added that to see if having  more 
        characters in the video title with capital letters influenced the 
        ability for the video to trending as shown on the table.</p>
        
        <p>When comparing the values of average views to percentage of capital 
        letters in titles, it is not clear the effect that caps in titles have 
        on the rate at which videos go trending, but it was interesting, but not
        too surprising, to see how categories such as "Pets & Animals", 
        "Travel & Events" and "How to & Style" with the highest percentage of 
        capital letter in their titles. This could be due to the creators of 
        these videos going for more clickbait-y titles. On the other hand, the 
        categories with the lowest amount of capital letters in their title were
        "Music", "Science & Technology", and "News & Politics" with News & 
        Politics having a significantly lower percentage of capitals, possibly 
        because news channels follow stricter guidelines when it comes to 
        presentations and naming their videos.</p>
